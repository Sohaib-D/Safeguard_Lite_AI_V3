        An IP (Internet Protocol) address is simply the mailing address of your computer on the internet. 
        Just like the post office uses your home address to deliver mail, computers use IP addresses to send data (like a web page or an email) to each other.

        A Brute Force attack is when a hacker uses a computer program to guess your password millions of times per second.
